# Python Project
Hello my name is Kamen Koshutanski. I usally program on C but I am tryin to study python. This project was written on Python.
## What is it about?
The project itself is simple. It's just a small minigame, written in the console, where you fight against different monsters.
## What is the project's goal?
It doesn't have one. It's just a minigame to play if you don't have anything else to do.
## How did i choose it?
Actually I don't know why but the project was given to us for around 2 months + a month to choose a theme but somehow I "slipped" through the net and in reallity I didn't had a theme for the project. And when around a month or two passed I guessed something was wrong so I was going to ask but we didn't have classes so I missed my chance. Then I decided to do my favourite thing - a game. There are two types of games that I like - simple or high-tech. Obviously I couldn't do high-tech so I stopped on simple. And because I like to write code on C I decided to do it in the console and not on a graphic menu
